## 🔧 System Components

### Core Validation Framework
- **SuperClaude v3 UI Validation Methodology**: Systematic testing protocol with 6-step validation cycle
- **Playwright Automation Engine**: Cross-browser testing with pixel-perfect comparison capabilities
- **Iterative Fix-Test Cycles**: Maximum 10 iterations with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Computer Vision Detection**: Automated UI problem identification and context-aware fixing

### Quality Standards
- **Visual Similarity**: 95% pixel-perfect comparison threshold
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (90%+ target)
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility matrix
- **Responsive Design**: 320px to 1920px viewport validation

## 🚀 Key Features
