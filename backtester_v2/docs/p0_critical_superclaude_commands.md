- WebSocket latency: <50ms (measure message round-trip time)
- Concurrent connections: Support 100+ simultaneous users
- Error rate: <1% under normal load (measure with load testing)
- Database query performance: <100ms for standard queries

SECURITY VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Authentication endpoints resist brute force attacks
- CSRF protection prevents cross-site request forgery
- Rate limiting blocks excessive requests
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Authorization checks prevent privilege escalation
- Sensitive data is properly encrypted in transit
- API keys and tokens are securely managed
- Audit logging captures all security events

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All API endpoints function correctly with real backend integration
- Error handling provides appropriate responses for all scenarios
- Authentication and authorization work correctly
- Performance meets all specified targets under load
- Security measures prevent common API attacks
- WebSocket real-time features work reliably
- Integration with all backend systems confirmed"

## âš¡ IMMEDIATE EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### **P0-CRITICAL Implementation Order**:
1. **Execute Task 2.3** (Authentication) - Foundation security requirement
2. **Execute Task 3.2** (Navigation) - User interface foundation
3. **Execute Task 3.1** (UI Components) - Component functionality foundation
4. **Execute Task 1.1** (App Router) - Routing foundation
5. **Execute Task 1.2** (API Endpoints) - Backend integration foundation

### **Validation Protocol for Each Command**:
- **NO MOCK DATA**: All testing must use real MySQL, HeavyDB, and market data
- **Functional Testing**: Every component must demonstrate actual functionality
- **Performance Measurement**: All performance claims require actual benchmarking
- **Integration Testing**: Frontend-backend integration must be validated
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive edge case and error scenario testing

### **Success Criteria for P0-CRITICAL Completion**:
- âœ… All authentication components functional with RBAC
- âœ… All 13 navigation components implemented and functional
- âœ… All core UI components verified with user interactions
- âœ… All app routes functional with proper error handling
- âœ… All API endpoints functional with backend integration
- âœ… Performance baseline established for optimization
- âœ… Integration testing framework operational

**ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Execute these 5 P0-CRITICAL SuperClaude commands to address the 75-point completion gap and establish solid foundation for remaining implementation.**
