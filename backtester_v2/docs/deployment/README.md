## Deployment Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (1 Week)
- **Users**: 2-3 internal team members
- **Focus**: Core functionality validation
- **Success**: 100% baseline performance, zero critical bugs

### Phase 2: Limited Pilot (2 Weeks)
- **Users**: 5-8 experienced traders
- **Focus**: User experience and workflow integration
- **Success**: â‰¥80% user satisfaction, â‰¥90% baseline performance

### Phase 3: Broader Pilot (4 Weeks)
- **Users**: 10-20 mixed experience levels
- **Focus**: Scalability and concurrent user handling
- **Success**: 20 concurrent users, <300ms response time, <5% error rate

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (1 Week)
- **Focus**: Final validation and authorization
- **Outcome**: GO/NO-GO decision for full production

## Key Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Processing Speed**: â‰¥37,303 rows/sec (validated baseline)
- **Response Time**: <300ms for 95% of requests
- **Error Rate**: <5% with rapid resolution
- **Uptime**: â‰¥99.9% availability

### User Experience Targets
- **User Satisfaction**: â‰¥80% positive feedback
- **Training Completion**: â‰¥90% of users
- **User Adoption**: â‰¥85% prefer new system
- **Session Success**: â‰¥90% successful sessions

### System Health Targets
- **CPU Usage**: <85% average
- **Memory Usage**: <90% peak
- **Database Connections**: <80% pool utilization
- **Disk Space**: >15% free minimum

## Risk Mitigation

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Performance degradation >25% from baseline
- Error rate >5% for sustained periods
- System resource exhaustion (CPU >95%, Memory >95%)
- Database connection failures >3 in 1 minute

### Manual Rollback Triggers
- User satisfaction <70% with multiple complaints
- Critical bugs affecting >50% of users
- Data integrity concerns
- Security incidents

### Rollback Capabilities
- **Target Time**: <15 minutes complete rollback
- **Data Protection**: Zero data loss guarantee
- **User Impact**: Minimal service disruption
- **Validation**: Comprehensive post-rollback verification

## Support Resources

### 24/7 On-Call Coverage
- **Primary**: DevOps Engineer (<5 minute response)
- **Secondary**: Senior Developer (<15 minute response)
