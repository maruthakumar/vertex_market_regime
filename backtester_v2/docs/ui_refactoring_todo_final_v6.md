## 🔄 AI DEVELOPMENT AGENT EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Sequential Execution Rules
1. **Execute tasks in exact order listed** (no parallel execution unless explicitly marked PARALLEL)
2. **Complete ALL validation criteria** before proceeding to next task
3. **If validation fails**, execute rollback procedure and retry with error analysis
4. **Report progress** using standardized format: `[AGENT_ID] [PHASE X.Y] [STATUS] [TASK NAME] - [DETAILS]`
5. **Coordinate with other agents** via shared state and conflict resolution protocol

### Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol
```yaml
Shared_Resources:
  Database_Connections: "Coordinate access to MySQL and HeavyDB"
  Configuration_Files: "Lock-based access to Excel configs"
  Test_Data: "Shared test datasets with read-only access"
  Build_Artifacts: "Coordinate build processes to avoid conflicts"

Conflict_Resolution:
  File_Modifications: "First-commit-wins with automatic merge conflict resolution"
  Database_Schema: "Schema changes require coordination approval"
  API_Endpoints: "Endpoint definitions shared via OpenAPI spec"
  Component_Interfaces: "TypeScript interfaces shared via types package"

Communication_Protocol:
  Status_Updates: "Every 30 minutes or on task completion"
  Error_Reporting: "Immediate notification with rollback status"
  Coordination_Requests: "For shared resource access or dependency changes"
  Completion_Notifications: "Phase gate completion with validation results"
```

### Dynamic TODO Expansion Protocol (**CRITICAL**)
When executing v6.0 analysis commands, AI agents **MUST**:

1. **Analyze command output** for additional requirements not in original TODO
2. **Identify missing components**, dependencies, or configuration needs
3. **Generate new TODO items** using this format:
   ```markdown
   ### DISCOVERED TASK X.Y.Z: [Task Name] (AUTO-GENERATED by [AGENT_ID])
   **Discovery Source:** Analysis of [original task] revealed [specific finding]
   **SuperClaude Command:** [New command based on discovery]
   **Priority:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] - [Justification]
   **Integration Point:** Insert after task [X.Y] before task [X.Z]
   **Agent Assignment:** [AGENT_ID] or [NEW_AGENT] if cross-cutting
   **Coordination Required:** [YES/NO] - [List of affected agents]
   ```
4. **Update phase completion criteria** to include discovered tasks
5. **Validate expanded TODO list** against v6.0 plan for consistency
6. **Notify coordination system** of TODO expansion for multi-agent synchronization

### Mandatory Validation Checkpoints
- **After each task**: Verify deliverable exists and meets criteria
- **After each phase**: Run phase validation gate tests
- **Before proceeding**: Confirm no blocking issues exist
- **During testing**: Validate against original `index_enterprise.html` functionality
- **Cross-agent validation**: Verify integration points work correctly
