# Product Requirements Document: BMAD-Enhanced Validation System

## Executive Summary

The BMAD-Enhanced Validation System is a comprehensive, multi-agent solution for validating Excel parameter mappings to backend systems with HeavyDB storage and GPU optimization. This system ensures 100% parameter coverage, zero synthetic data usage, and sub-50ms query performance across all trading strategies.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Parameter Validation Gaps**: Manual validation misses edge cases and dependencies
2. **Performance Issues**: Unoptimized queries causing >100ms response times
3. **Data Integrity Concerns**: Synthetic test data contaminating production validations
4. **Lack of Standardization**: Each strategy validated differently
5. **No GPU Optimization**: Missing performance benefits of HeavyDB GPU acceleration

### Impact
- Incorrect parameter mappings lead to trading errors
- Slow queries impact real-time decision making
- Synthetic data creates false confidence in system behavior
- Inconsistent validation creates maintenance burden
