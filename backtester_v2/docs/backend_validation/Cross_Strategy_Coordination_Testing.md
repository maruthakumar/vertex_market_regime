# Cross-Strategy Coordination Testing Documentation
## SuperClaude v3 Enhanced Multi-Strategy Framework

### Coordination Scenarios

#### 1. Multi-Strategy Portfolio
- **Scenario**: Multiple strategies running simultaneously
- **Coordination**: Resource allocation and conflict resolution
- **Testing**: Parallel execution with performance monitoring

#### 2. Strategy Conflict Resolution
- **Scenario**: Conflicting signals from different strategies
- **Coordination**: Priority-based signal resolution
- **Testing**: Conflict detection and resolution validation

#### 3. Resource Sharing
- **Scenario**: Shared HeavyDB connections and data sources
- **Coordination**: Connection pooling and data caching
- **Testing**: Resource utilization monitoring

#### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Scenario**: Cross-strategy performance optimization
- **Coordination**: Load balancing and parallel processing
- **Testing**: Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Integration Points

### Multi-Strategy Workflows

#### Portfolio Optimization Workflow
1. Load all strategy configurations
2. Optimize capital allocation
3. Execute strategies in coordination
4. Monitor portfolio performance
5. Rebalance as needed

#### Risk Management Workflow
1. Monitor individual strategy risks
2. Calculate portfolio-level risk
3. Apply risk limits and controls
4. Generate risk reports
5. Alert on risk threshold breaches

#### Performance Monitoring Workflow
1. Collect strategy performance metrics
2. Calculate portfolio performance
3. Compare against benchmarks
4. Generate performance reports
5. Identify optimization opportunities

#### Resource Allocation Workflow
1. Monitor resource utilization
2. Allocate resources based on priority
3. Balance load across strategies
4. Optimize resource usage
5. Scale resources as needed
