# HeavyDB Backtester Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Exit Time and Stop-Loss/Take-Profit Functionality**
   - Fixed time format inconsistencies (HHMMSS vs HH:MM:SS)
   - Added proper exit reason handling with appropriate defaults
   - Improved datetime handling in risk evaluation logic
   - Added fall-back mechanisms for empty tick data

2. **Date Format Consistency**
   - Standardized all date formats to YYYY-MM-DD
   - Improved date parsing for different input formats
   - Added robust error handling for date conversion failures

3. **NumberType Enum Support**
   - Added support for INDEX_POINTS, INDEX_PERCENTAGE, and ABSOLUTE_DELTA in NumberType enum
   - Added proper handling of these types in risk rule evaluation
   - Ensured consistent exit reason strings for different risk rule types

4. **Configuration Improvements**
   - Made INPUT_FILE_FOLDER and PORTFOLIO_LEGACY_FILE_PATH configurable via environment variables
   - Fixed hardcoded paths for better portability

5. **Strike Premium Condition Handling**
   - Fixed StrikePremiumCondition and HedgeStrikePremiumCondition handling in strategy_parser.py
   - Eliminated "Unknown or unsupported indicator" warnings

## Files Modified

1. **trade_builder.py**
   - Improved _dt_components() for better time formatting
   - Enhanced date handling in build_test_trade()
   - Fixed expiry date formatting

2. **heavydb_trade_processing.py**
   - Added new evaluate_trade_exit() function
   - Improved tick data filtering and fallback mechanisms
   - Enhanced exit reason handling

3. **models/risk.py**
   - Updated NumberType enum with additional values
   - Added support for new number types in evaluation logic
   - Improved exit reason consistency

4. **config.py**
   - Made paths configurable via environment variables
   - Fixed hardcoded paths

5. **excel_parser/strategy_parser.py**
   - Fixed StrikePremiumCondition and HedgeStrikePremiumCondition handling

## Verification

Tests were created to verify:
- The NumberType enum contains all required values
- Date formatting correctly converts to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Time formatting correctly converts to HH:MM:SS format
- Configuration paths are properly configurable

The python_refactor_plan.md file was updated to reflect the progress:
- Phase 1.J (Column-mapping integrity) is now at 95% completion
- Phase 1.K (GPU parity) is now at 90% completion

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining unit tests for Phase 1.J
2. Add CI job for parity testing (Phase 1.K)
3. Continue with Phase 1.B for increased unit test coverage
