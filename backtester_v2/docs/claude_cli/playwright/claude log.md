● Perfect! You want me to enhance the plan with:

  1. Backend integration module-level mapping from docs/backend_integration_update_summary.md
  2. ML integration details from docs/ml_integration_update_summary.md
  3. Update the base document from v3 to v4 with all new details
  4. Maintain the original flow while adding comprehensive backend and ML integration mapping

  Let me first examine the backend and ML integration documents to understand the module-level
  mapping:


● Read(../docs/backend_integration_update_summary.md)

  ⎿  Read 224 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



● Read(../docs/ml_integration_update_summary.md)

  ⎿  Read 206 lines (ctrl+r to expand)



● Perfect! Now I have all the information needed. Let me present the comprehensive plan to:

  1. Update base_system_verification_superclaude_v3.md to v4 with backend integration mapping
  2. Add detailed module-level mapping from backend and ML integration summaries
  3. Enhance the plan without changing the core flow
  4. Include comprehensive backend integration details for all 7 strategies

  ⎿ Plan: Create Base System Verification SuperClaude v4 with Enhanced Backend Integration

    Current Situation Analysis

    The Next.js system is running on port 3030 and requires comprehensive upgrade of the base system
     verification document from v3 to v4, incorporating detailed backend integration mapping and 
    module-level paths for all 7 strategies.

    Plan Overview

    Upgrade docs/base_system_verification_superclaude_v3.md → 
    docs/base_system_verification_superclaude_v4.md

    Key Enhancements:
    1. Backend Integration Module Mapping - Add complete backend paths for all strategies
    2. ML Integration Details - Include ML Triple Rolling Straddle System integration
    3. Production File Structure - Map Excel upload files to backend processing modules
    4. Enhanced Testing Protocol - Excel Upload → Strategy Execution → Progress → Logs → Results
    5. Iterative Fix-Retest Cycle - Test → Validate → Fix → Retest → Screenshot Evidence

    Document Enhancement Structure

    Phase 0: Infrastructure & Environment Setup Enhancement

    Add Backend Integration Validation:

    Task 0.1: Docker Environment Validation (Enhanced)

    /sc:test --persona qa,devops,backend --context:auto --sequential --evidence --playwright
    Enhanced Core Workflow Setup:
    - Validate Docker environment supports Excel upload processing
    - Verify HeavyDB connections (localhost:6274, 33.19M+ rows)
    - NEW: Test backend module paths for all 7 strategies
    - NEW: Validate strategy optimization system paths
    - NEW: Test ML system integration paths
    - Test file upload directories: backtester_v2/configurations/data/prod/
    - Validate WebSocket connections for progress tracking
    - Test log aggregation and display systems

    Task 0.2: Backend Module Integration Validation (NEW)

    /sc:test --persona qa,backend,integration --context:auto --sequential --evidence --playwright

> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The 
  conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to capture all technical details, user requests, 
  and actions taken:

  1. **Initial Request**: User asked how to address a Node.js system running on localhost:3000 
  according to the plan in `docs/base_system_verification_superclaude_v3.md`

  2. **System Discovery**: I found the Next.js system was actually running on port 3030 (not 3000) 
  and examined the comprehensive verification plan document

  3. **Plan Mode Activation**: The system was in plan mode, preventing execution of changes until 
  user approval

  4. **User Corrections**: User provided several critical corrections:
     - Emphasized the core workflow: Excel Upload → Strategy Execution → Progress → Logs → Results 
  Integration
     - Corrected that TV = TradingView (not Trading Volume)
     - Specified to use HeavyDB only (MySQL is archive)
     - Specified production files location: `backtester_v2/configurations/data/prod/`
     - Requested iterative testing protocol: test→validate→fix→retest→screenshot evidence
     - Asked to save evidence in `docs/claude_cli/playwright/`

  5. **Enhanced Plan Request**: User requested analysis of backend integration documents and asked 
  to:
     - Update `base_system_verification_superclaude_v3.md` to `v4`
     - Include backend integration module mapping
     - Add ML integration details
     - Enhance without changing core flow
     - Include comprehensive backend integration details

  6. **Final Plan Approval**: User approved the comprehensive plan for creating the enhanced v4 
  document

  The conversation focused heavily on system verification, backend integration, and comprehensive 
  testing protocols for a Next.js backtesting system with 7 strategies.

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user requested help addressing a Node.js system running on localhost:3000 according to a 
  verification plan. However, the system was actually running on port 3030. The core intent evolved 
  to create a comprehensive testing and verification plan for a Next.js backtesting system with 7 
  strategies, focusing on the critical business workflow: Excel Upload → Strategy Execution → 
  Progress Tracking → Logs → Results Display. The user specifically requested upgrading the base 
  system verification document from v3 to v4 with enhanced backend integration mapping and ML system
   details.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Next.js 15.3.5 application running on port 3030
     - SuperClaude v3 testing framework with personas and context flags
     - HeavyDB database with 33.19M+ rows of option chain data
     - 7 trading strategies: TBS, TV (TradingView), ORB, OI, ML Indicator, POS, Market Regime
     - Backend integration module mapping across strategy directories
     - ML Triple Rolling Straddle System with Zone×DTE (5×10 Grid)
     - Playwright MCP for screenshot evidence collection
     - Iterative testing protocol: test→validate→fix→retest→screenshot
     - Production file structure in `backtester_v2/configurations/data/prod/`
     - WebSocket real-time progress tracking and log streaming
     - Golden format results processing and display

  3. Files and Code Sections:

  _verification_superclaude_v3.md`
       - Comprehensive 1036-line verification strategy document
       - Contains 5-phase verification approach with 223 testable components
       - Includes SuperClaude v3 commands for systematic testing

       - Development and production scripts
       - Dependencies including React 19, TailwindCSS, authentication libraries

  4. Errors and fixes:
     - **Port Confusion**: Initially thought system was on port 3000, but discovered it was actually
   on port 3030 through process inspection
     - **Plan Mode Restrictions**: Multiple attempts to exit plan mode were rejected until user 
  provided explicit approval
     - **Strategy Name Correction**: User corrected that TV = TradingView (not Trading Volume)
     - **Database Clarification**: User specified to use HeavyDB only, not MySQL (which is archive)
     - **File Path Corrections**: User specified correct production file paths: 
  `backtester_v2/configurations/data/prod/`

  5. Problem Solving:
     - Discovered the actual running port through system process inspection
     - Analyzed comprehensive verification strategy document to understand testing requirements
     - Mapped backend integration paths for all 7 strategies from integration summary documents
     - Created enhanced testing protocol incorporating user feedback about iterative fix-retest 
  cycles
     - Integrated ML system backend mapping for complex ML workflows

  v3 command to test everything , TV is NOT TIME VOLUME , it is Trading VIEW , also use the proper 
  input files backtester_v2/configurations/data/prod for uploads... also please add other 
  comprehsive plan docs/base_system_verification_superclaude_v3.md and always - 
  test-->validate-->fix issue-->again retest-->repeat until fix --if it fixed then take screen shot 
  using playwright mcp until it is fixed , save it docs/claude_cli/playwright"

● Perfect! The Next.js application is already running on port 3030. Now I'll proceed with Phase 0
  testing. Let me start with the Docker environment validation:

● Excellent! I can see the complete backend strategies structure is available. Now let me test the
  mock authentication system and collect evidence using Playwright screenshots. Let me start taking
  screenshots to document our testing evidence:
