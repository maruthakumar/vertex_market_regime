# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the Market Regime Master Framework project with an 8-component adaptive learning system integrated with Google Vertex AI. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing backtester_v2 system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing project architecture by defining how the new 8-component adaptive learning framework will integrate with the current HeavyDB-based backtester system. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

**Current Project State:**
- **Primary Purpose:** Quantitative trading system with market regime classification for options strategies
- **Current Tech Stack:** Python 3.8+, HeavyDB, Pandas/cuDF, Excel-based configuration, REST APIs
- **Architecture Style:** Modular monolithic architecture with plugin-based strategy system
- **Deployment Method:** Local deployment with SSH server integration and HeavyDB infrastructure

**Available Documentation:**
- Market Regime Master Framework v1.0 specification with 8-component adaptive system
- Vertex AI PRD for cloud migration and ML enhancement
- BMAD orchestration documentation for deployment automation
- HeavyDB connection guides and performance optimization documentation
- Comprehensive strategy testing documentation across 31 Excel configuration sheets

**Identified Constraints:**
- Performance requirement: <800ms total processing time for 8-component analysis
- Memory constraint: <3.7GB total system memory usage
- Accuracy target: >85% regime classification accuracy
- Existing HeavyDB infrastructure must be preserved and integrated
- 600+ Excel configuration parameters must be maintained and mapped to ML hyperparameters
- Zero-downtime migration requirement for production trading systems
