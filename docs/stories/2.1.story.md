### IAM Requirements
**Note:** If IAM setup is not complete, coordinate with Story 2.5 (IAM, Artifact Registry, Budgets/Monitoring) for proper permissions.

Required roles for implementation:
- `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` - For creating and managing BigQuery datasets and tables
- `roles/bigquery.jobUser` - For running BigQuery queries and jobs
- `roles/aiplatform.user` - For Vertex AI Feature Store operations
- `roles/storage.objectViewer` - For reading Parquet files from GCS
- `roles/logging.logWriter` - For writing logs to Cloud Logging

Service Account naming convention: `sa-market-regime-{env}@{project-id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### Epic 1 Schema Registry Location
The feature definitions from Epic 1 can be found in:
- Schema Registry: `/vertex_market_regime/src/features/schema_registry/` (if implemented)
- Component Specifications: `/docs/market_regime/` (component 1-8 documentation)
- Feature Count Reference: Epic 1 Story implementations in `/docs/stories/1.*.story.md`
- If schema registry not yet implemented, extract from Epic 1 component implementations in `/vertex_market_regime/src/components/`

### Existing ML Documentation (IMPORTANT - USE THESE)
The following specifications have already been created and MUST be used as the foundation for implementation:
- **Feature Store Specification**: `/docs/ml/feature-store-spec.md` - Contains entity type definitions, online feature set (32 features), TTLs
- **Offline Feature Tables**: `/docs/ml/offline-feature-tables.md` - Contains BigQuery DDL examples, table structures, partitioning/clustering specs
- **Vertex AI Setup**: `/docs/ml/vertex-ai-setup.md` - Contains GCP project ID (`arched-bot-269016`), regions, IAM roles, and setup commands
- **Training Pipeline Spec**: `/docs/ml/training-pipeline-spec.md` - For reference in future stories

### Testing Requirements [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test framework: pytest
- Test location: `/vertex_market_regime/tests/vertex_ai/`
- Required test types:
  - Unit tests for schema mappings
  - Integration tests for BigQuery table creation
  - Performance tests for query patterns
  - Validation tests for Feature Store entity types
- Coverage requirement: 90%+ for new code
- Use structured JSON logging for test outputs

### Coding Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- PEP 8 compliance with 120 character line limit
- Google-style docstrings with type hints
- Black code formatting
- Structured JSON output for all logging
- Error handling with graceful fallback and retry logic

### Important Notes
- No HeavyDB dependencies - system uses Parquet â Arrow â GPU architecture
- Focus on Vertex AI ML infrastructure only
- BigQuery serves as offline feature store
- Vertex AI Feature Store provides online serving
- All features derived from Epic 1 schema registry
