# Epic 5: Adaptive Learning and Drift Management
**Duration:** Weeks 7-8  
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** HIGH - Sustain ≥95% precision

## Epic Goal
Implement adaptive learning, drift detection, and champion–challenger deployment to sustain precision@threshold ≥95% under changing market conditions.

## Epic Description
- Continuous monitoring of data/label drift and model performance
- Scheduled re-calibration/retraining with automated promotion criteria
- A/B testing (champion–challenger) and safe rollbacks

## Epic Stories

### Story 1: Drift Detection Pipeline
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Feature/label drift metrics (KS, PSI, ADWIN) computed on rolling windows
- [ ] Alerts when drift exceeds thresholds; investigation checklist

### Story 2: Re-Calibration and Threshold Refresh
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Periodic calibration job (e.g., weekly) recomputes thresholds to keep precision ≥95%
- [ ] New gating config versioned; rollback available

### Story 3: Automated Retraining and Model Promotion
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Retraining pipeline triggers on schedule or drift event
- [ ] Champion–challenger A/B with promotion policy (win condition: precision@thr maintained/improved at same or higher coverage)

### Story 4: Endpoint Management and Safety
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Traffic split automation; automatic rollback on SLO breach
- [ ] Audit trail of promotions; model card with data window/metrics

## Validation Gates
- [ ] Drift pipeline live; alerts validated
- [ ] Calibration refresh produces ≥95% precision; coverage tracked
- [ ] Retrain → A/B → promotion flow executed in staging

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Sustained precision@threshold ≥95% over agreed horizon
- [ ] Documented ops procedures and promotion policy
