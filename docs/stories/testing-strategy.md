# Testing Strategy

## Integration with Existing Tests

**Existing Test Framework:** pytest with fixtures for HeavyDB data, comprehensive Excel configuration testing
**Test Organization:** Unit tests per component, integration tests per module, end-to-end workflow testing  
**Coverage Requirements:** Maintain existing 90% coverage while adding comprehensive adaptive learning tests

## New Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for New Components
- **Framework:** pytest with mock objects for external ML services
- **Location:** `backtester_v2/ui-centralized/strategies/market_regime/adaptive_learning/tests/`
- **Coverage Target:** 95% coverage for all 8 adaptive components
- **Integration with Existing:** Extend existing test fixtures with adaptive learning data

### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** End-to-end testing of 8-component pipeline with real HeavyDB data
- **Existing System Verification:** Ensure no regression in existing regime classification accuracy
- **New Feature Testing:** Validate <800ms performance target and >85% accuracy improvement

### Regression Testing  
- **Existing Feature Verification:** Automated testing of all existing backtester functionality with new components disabled
- **Automated Regression Suite:** Daily regression tests against historical market data  
- **Manual Testing Requirements:** Monthly review of trading signal quality by quantitative analysts
