# Epic 4: Production Readiness
**Duration:** Weeks 5-6  
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Launch quality

## Epic Goal
Harden the system for production with performance tuning, security/compliance, observability, runbooks, rollback drills, and final validation to meet or exceed base targets (stretch where possible).

## Epic Description
- Performance hardening and cost optimization (local vs cloud paths)
- Security hardening across API, data, and cloud resources
- Observability dashboards with SLO/SLA tracking
- Ops runbooks and incident playbooks; rollback drills
- Final BMAD validation gates passed

## Epic Stories

### Story 1: Performance Hardening and Cost Optimization
**As a** performance engineer  
**I want** tuned latency, memory, and autoscaling with cost controls  
**So that** we meet SLOs reliably and affordably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Total P95 latency ≤ 800ms (stretch ≤ 600ms) sustained under load
- [ ] Peak memory ≤ 3.7GB (stretch ≤ 2.5GB)
- [ ] Autoscaling thresholds tuned; cold starts mitigated
- [ ] Cost budgets and alerts verified; optimizations applied

---

### Story 2: Security and Compliance Hardening
**As a** security engineer  
**I want** least-privilege IAM, hardened network, and data protections  
**So that** the system meets security and compliance requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] SSH restricted to approved CIDRs; VPN finalized (tunnels/peers)
- [ ] IAM least-privilege roles reviewed; key rotation in place
- [ ] Audit logs enabled; sensitive logs redacted
- [ ] Data retention and encryption policies enforced

---

### Story 3: Observability and SLO Dashboards
**As a** SRE  
**I want** dashboards and alerts aligned to SLOs  
**So that** teams can detect and respond to issues fast

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboards: latency (P50/P95), memory, error rate, cache hit, feature latency
- [ ] Alerts: latency budget breach, accuracy drop, feature store failures
- [ ] On-call rota and escalation documented

---

### Story 4: Operations Runbooks and Rollback Drills
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** runbooks/playbooks and tested rollback  
**So that** incidents can be resolved quickly without user impact

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Runbooks for deploy, scale, failover, endpoint issues
- [ ] Rollback drills executed and timed; RTO/RPO documented
- [ ] Postmortem template and process adopted

---

### Story 5: Final BMAD Validation
**As a** product owner  
**I want** final BMAD validation gates executed  
**So that** we can approve launch with evidence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Architecture, Performance, Integration, Quality gates passed
- [ ] Evidence stored under `docs/validation/` with summaries
- [ ] Launch Go/No-Go checklist completed and approved

## Validation Gates (Go/No-Go)
- [ ] Sustained performance under load; SLOs met for 7 days
- [ ] Security review passed; pen test issues addressed
- [ ] Monitoring/alerts stable; no false positives
- [ ] Rollback drills successful; RTO/RPO met

## Success Metrics
- SLO adherence ≥ 99% for latency and availability
- Cost within budget with headroom
- All validation artifacts complete and reviewed

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Performance hardening and cost controls in place
- [ ] Security, compliance, and audit posture verified
- [ ] Observability dashboards live; alerts tuned
- [ ] Runbooks and rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Final BMAD validation passed; launch approved
