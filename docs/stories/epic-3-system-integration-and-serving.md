# Epic 3: System Integration and Serving
**Duration:** Weeks 3-4  
**Status:** Planned  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - End-to-end runtime path

## Epic Goal
Integrate the 8-component analysis with master integration, wire online feature serving, and expose API v2 endpoints that meet base performance targets (<800ms total). This epic turns validated feature engineering (Epic 1) and provisioned infra (Epic 2) into a cohesive, low-latency runtime service.

## Epic Description
- Orchestrate all 8 components in parallel with strict per-component budgets and fallbacks
- Perform master integration and 8-regime classification using adaptive weights
- Retrieve online features from Vertex AI Feature Store with training/serving parity
- Provide API v2 endpoints with authentication, monitoring, and structured logs

## Epic Stories

### Story 1: Component Orchestration Service
**As a** backend engineer  
**I want** an orchestration service that executes 8 components in parallel with per-component budgets and fallbacks  
**So that** total analysis is reliable and predictable under SLOs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Parallel execution with per-component timeout using budgets from Architecture
- [ ] Graceful fallback results when a component exceeds its budget or errors
- [ ] Structured timing and memory metrics per component
- [ ] Deterministic run ordering and robust error handling

---

### Story 2: Master Integration and Regime Classification
**As a** quantitative engineer  
**I want** master integration that combines component outputs with adaptive weights  
**So that** the system produces an accurate 8-regime classification

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Master integration consumes all component outputs and uses adaptive weights
- [ ] Produces 8-regime classification (LVLD/HVC/VCPE/TBVE/TBVS/SCGS/PSED/CBV)
- [ ] Accuracy baseline ≥ 87% on validation set (PRD)
- [ ] Exposes weights and agreement metrics for observability

### Story 3: Online Feature Serving via Vertex AI Feature Store
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** online feature retrieval with parity to training definitions  
**So that** serving uses correct, versioned features at low latency

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Retrieve features from Vertex AI Feature Store entity types defined in Epic 2
- [ ] P50 < 20ms, P95 < 50ms for online feature lookup
- [ ] Parity checks between online and offline features (sampled)
- [ ] Robust caching strategy with TTL and invalidation

---

### Story 4: API v2 Endpoints (Analyze, Weights, Health)
**As a** API engineer  
**I want** production-grade endpoints with auth, docs, and observability  
**So that** consumers can integrate reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `/api/v2/regime/analyze` returns classification, component results, timings
- [ ] `/api/v2/regime/weights` manages adaptive weight inspection/updates (per policy)
- [ ] `/api/v2/regime/health` reports system/component health and SLO adherence
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.0 docs and examples published
- [ ] AuthN/AuthZ integrated; rate limiting and input validation configured

---

### Story 5: Latency Optimization and Caching
**As a** performance engineer  
**I want** end-to-end latency optimization with caches and memory reuse  
**So that** total response time meets SLO targets

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Total runtime (local/cloud) <800ms base; stretch path documented
- [ ] Component-level caching/memory reuse validated; no leaks
- [ ] Cold-start mitigation plan for model/feature warmups
- [ ] Performance tests with realistic payloads; baseline recorded

---

### Story 6: Monitoring, Logging, and Alerts
**As a** SRE  
**I want** comprehensive observability and alerts  
**So that** regressions are detected and acted upon quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Structured JSON logs with request ids and timings
- [ ] Metrics: per-component time, memory, cache hit rate, online feature latency
- [ ] Alerts on latency budget breach, accuracy drop, component timeouts
- [ ] Dashboards for API and component performance

## Validation Gates (Go/No-Go)
- [ ] All 8 components orchestrated with budgets enforced; fallbacks validated
- [ ] Total latency (P95) ≤ 800ms, memory ≤ 3.7GB (base targets)
- [ ] Accuracy ≥ 87% on validation set
- [ ] API v2 endpoints pass integration tests and auth checks
- [ ] Online feature lookups meet latency SLOs; parity spot-checks pass

## Success Metrics
- Total P95 latency ≤ 800ms (stretch ≤ 600ms after optimization)
- Memory peak ≤ 3.7GB (stretch ≤ 2.5GB)
- Accuracy ≥ 87%; component agreement ≥ 85%
- Error budget policy defined and tracked

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Orchestration service, master integration, and API v2 implemented and tested
- [ ] Online feature serving integrated with parity checks
- [ ] Observability and alerts active; runbooks drafted
- [ ] Performance baselines documented; gates passed
- [ ] Handoff to Epic 4 (production readiness) with risks noted
