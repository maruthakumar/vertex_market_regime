## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the foundational infrastructure for the 8-component adaptive learning system described in Epic 1. The framework will be integrated into the existing `backtester_v2/ui-centralized/strategies/market_regime/` structure without modifying existing implementations.

**Critical Performance Requirements:**
- **Total System Target**: <800ms processing time (NOT <2s as originally specified)
- **Memory Constraint**: <3.7GB total system memory usage
- **Component Breakdown**: Support 774 total features across components (120/98/105/87/94/150/72/48)
- **Foundation Target**: Framework overhead must be <50ms to leave budget for components

**Integration with Existing System:**
- **Execution Path**: Local Parquet → Arrow → RAPIDS/cuDF on GPU (HeavyDB deprecated)
- **File Structure**: New files in `adaptive_learning/` subdirectory under existing `market_regime/`
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing API endpoints and functionality preserved
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to existing algorithms if GPU/cache unavailable

    └── tests/                   # Framework tests
```

**Component Feature Schema Structure:**
Each component schema must define:
- Feature names, types, and valid ranges
- Calibration notes and thresholds  
- Version compatibility and migration paths
- Integration points with Vertex AI Feature Store (Epic 2)

**Key Implementation Requirements:**
- All transforms must implement `AdaptiveComponent` base class interface
- GPU memory management with automatic cleanup and monitoring
- Schema versioning for backward compatibility from v1.0
- Performance logging for sub-component timing (<800ms total budget)

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Framework**: pytest with existing fixtures for HeavyDB data
- **Location**: `backtester_v2/ui-centralized/strategies/market_regime/adaptive_learning/tests/`
- **Coverage**: 90% minimum (existing standard), targeting 95% for new framework
- **Integration**: Extend existing test fixtures with adaptive learning data
- **Performance**: Memory profiling and GPU utilization benchmarks required
- **Patterns**: Unit tests per component, integration tests per module, end-to-end workflow testing

**Critical Test Requirements:**
- No GPU memory leaks in continuous testing
- Schema validation for all 774 features across 8 components
- Cache performance characteristics and TTL behavior
- Fallback behavior when GPU/external services unavailable
- Performance benchmarks within <800ms system budget

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates senior-level architecture and design patterns. The developer has successfully created a comprehensive, well-structured framework that fully meets all requirements. The code shows excellent separation of concerns, proper error handling, and robust performance monitoring. The implementation of the 8-component schema system with 774 features is mathematically correct and well-validated.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `base_component.py`
  - **Change**: Enhanced memory budget validation with critical threshold detection
  - **Why**: Original implementation only logged warnings for memory overuse without critical failure protection
  - **How**: Added 125% critical threshold that raises GPUMemoryError to prevent system-wide memory exhaustion

- **File**: `__init__.py`
  - **Change**: Improved performance budget validation with warning thresholds
  - **Why**: Original implementation lacked proactive warning system for approaching budget limits
  - **How**: Added 90% warning threshold to provide early alerts before budget violations, enhanced error messages with system context

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✓** Excellent PEP 8 compliance, proper docstrings, type hints, and 120-char limit adherence
- Project Structure: **✓** Perfect integration with existing `/adaptive_learning/` structure, no disruption to existing codebase
- Testing Strategy: **✓** Comprehensive test coverage with validation script passing all checks, 95% coverage target achievable
- All ACs Met: **✓** All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced memory budget validation with critical thresholds (base_component.py)
- [x] Added performance warning system for proactive monitoring (__init__.py)
- [x] Validated framework overhead stays well within <50ms budget through testing
- [x] Confirmed Component 02 gamma weight fix (1.5 for pin risk) properly implemented
