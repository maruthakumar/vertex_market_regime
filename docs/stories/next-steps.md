# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

**Prompt for Story Manager:**

"Implement the Market Regime Master Framework 8-Component Adaptive Learning System based on the comprehensive brownfield architecture document. Key integration requirements validated with the existing system:

- **Performance Constraint**: Total system processing must be <800ms with <3.7GB memory usage
- **Accuracy Target**: >85% regime classification accuracy while maintaining existing system performance  
- **Integration Points**: Seamlessly integrate with existing HeavyDB infrastructure at `strategies/market_regime/`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain 100% API compatibility with existing trading system integrations

**First Story Implementation**: Begin with Component 1 (Triple Rolling Straddle System) integration, implementing the adaptive weight learning engine while preserving existing straddle analysis functionality. Include comprehensive integration checkpoints to validate no performance degradation in the existing backtester system.

**System Integrity Priority**: Throughout implementation, existing system functionality must remain unimpacted. All new adaptive learning components should run in parallel with existing systems initially, with gradual migration based on validation results."

## Developer Handoff

**Prompt for Developers:**

"Begin implementing the 8-Component Adaptive Learning System following the brownfield architecture specifications. Reference the comprehensive architecture document for detailed technical decisions based on real project constraints.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Extend existing `backtester_v2/ui-centralized/strategies/market_regime/` structure
- Maintain all existing Excel parameter mapping (600+ parameters â†’ ML hyperparameters)  
- Preserve HeavyDB integration patterns and connection pooling
- Follow existing code style with PEP 8 compliance and Google-style docstrings

**Implementation Sequence**:
1. **Component 1**: Implement adaptive triple straddle system with 10-component weighting
2. **ML Pipeline**: Set up Vertex AI integration with fallback to existing algorithms
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement real-time component performance tracking
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate each component against existing system accuracy

**Critical Verification Steps**:
- Each component must have graceful fallback to existing implementations
- All database changes must be additive only (no existing schema modifications)
- API changes must maintain backward compatibility with version-controlled enhancement
- Performance testing must validate <800ms total processing time for all 8 components

**Existing System Compatibility**: Before proceeding with any implementation, thoroughly test existing system functionality to establish baseline performance metrics. All enhancements must preserve existing trading system reliability.
