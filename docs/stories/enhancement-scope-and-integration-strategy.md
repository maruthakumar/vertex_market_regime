# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

**Enhancement Type:** Major system enhancement with ML integration and cloud deployment
**Scope:** Integration of 8-component adaptive learning framework with existing backtester_v2 system and HeavyDB infrastructure
**Integration Impact:** Medium - Significant new functionality while preserving existing system operations

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** Modular enhancement with backward compatibility - new 8-component framework will be implemented as enhanced modules within the existing `strategies/market_regime/` directory structure, maintaining all existing API contracts while adding new ML-enhanced capabilities.

**Database Integration:** Parquet-first architecture on GCS with Arrow in-memory processing and RAPIDS/cuDF. HeavyDB is deprecated and allowed only as a temporary, read-only migration source; end-state removes HeavyDB entirely. Optional BigQuery is used for analytics/reporting.

**API Integration:** Extension of existing REST API framework with new endpoints for 8-component analysis while maintaining full backward compatibility with current trading system integrations.

**UI Integration:** Enhancement of existing UI framework in `backtester_v2/ui-centralized/` with new dashboards for component monitoring and adaptive learning visualization, preserving all existing strategy configuration interfaces.

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** 100% backward compatibility maintained for all existing endpoints
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** HeavyDB schema preserved with optional new tables for ML metadata
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Enhanced dashboards follow existing design patterns and navigation structure
- **Performance Impact:** New system must not degrade existing backtester performance (<3 second regime analysis maintained)
