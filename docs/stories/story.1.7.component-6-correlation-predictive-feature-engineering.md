**Example**:
```
Yesterday: NIFTY @ 20000 → ATM=20000, ITM1=19950, OTM1=20050
Today: NIFTY @ 20100 (gap up) → ATM=20100, ITM1=20050, OTM1=20150

Correlation Analysis:
- Today's ATM (20100 straddle) vs Yesterday's ATM (20000 straddle)  
- Today's ITM1 (20050 straddle) vs Yesterday's ITM1 (19950 straddle)
- Today's OTM1 (20150 straddle) vs Yesterday's OTM1 (20050 straddle)
```

#### **Gap-Adjusted Correlation Weights**:
- **No Gap** (-0.2% to +0.2%): Full correlation weight (1.0x) - Normal ATM/ITM1/OTM1 correlation
- **Small Gap** (-0.5% to +0.5%): Reduced correlation weight (0.8x) - Slight moneyness shift adjustment

- **Large Gap** (-2.0% to +2.0%): Low correlation weight (0.4x) - Major strike migration impact
- **Extreme Gap** (>2.0%): Minimal correlation weight (0.2x) - Correlation patterns disrupted
