## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**Epic 1 Phase 2 Foundation** [Source: Epic 1 completion]
- BigQuery offline tables: 932 features across 8 components (Stories 2.1 & 2.2 complete)
- Component 1→6→7 momentum enhancement chain operational
- Feature Store mapping specification already defined

**Vertex AI Feature Store Configuration** [Source: Epic 2 requirements]
- Entity Type: `instrument_minute`
- Entity ID Format: `${symbol}_${yyyymmddHHMM}_${dte}`
- Online Features: 32 core features (4 per component) for low-latency serving
- TTL: 48 hours for minute-level features, 30 days for daily aggregates
- Performance Target: <25ms feature retrieval latency

### Technical Specifications
**GCP Project Configuration**
- Project ID: `arched-bot-269016`
- Region: `us-central1` (same as BigQuery for data locality)
- Feature Store instance: `market-regime-feature-store`
- Entity Type: `instrument_minute`

**Core Online Feature Set (32 features)**
Based on existing Feature Store specification:
- Component 1: c1_momentum_score, c1_vol_compression, c1_breakout_probability, c1_transition_probability
- Component 2: c2_gamma_exposure, c2_sentiment_level, c2_pin_risk_score, c2_max_pain_level
- Component 3: c3_institutional_flow_score, c3_divergence_type, c3_range_expansion_score, c3_volume_profile
- Component 4: c4_skew_bias_score, c4_term_structure_signal, c4_iv_regime_level, c4_volatility_rank
- Component 5: c5_momentum_score, c5_volatility_regime_score, c5_confluence_score, c5_trend_strength
- Component 6: c6_correlation_agreement_score, c6_breakdown_alert, c6_system_stability_score, c6_prediction_confidence

### Performance Requirements
**Latency Targets**
- Feature retrieval: <50ms (target: <25ms)
- Batch ingestion: <5 minutes for full dataset
- Streaming ingestion: <30 seconds for new data points

**Throughput Targets**
- Online serving: 1000 RPS sustained
- Concurrent users: 100+ simultaneous feature requests
- Data freshness: <2 minutes lag from source data

### Integration Points
**Upstream Dependencies**
- BigQuery offline tables from Stories 2.1 & 2.2
- Component feature outputs from Epic 1 Phase 2
- GCP project and IAM setup (will coordinate with Story 2.5 if needed)

**Downstream Dependencies**
- Model training pipelines (Story 2.4)
- Real-time inference serving (Epic 3)
- Monitoring and alerting systems

### File Locations

### Risk Mitigation
**Primary Risks**
1. **Latency Performance**: Feature serving exceeds 50ms target
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, regional optimization, feature vector optimization
   
2. **Data Consistency**: Online/offline feature drift
   - Mitigation: Automated validation, point-in-time verification, reconciliation jobs

3. **Cost Overruns**: Feature Store costs exceed budget
   - Mitigation: Usage monitoring, automatic scaling policies, cost alerts

### Success Criteria
**Technical Validation**
- All 32 core features available in Feature Store with <50ms latency
- Point-in-time retrieval accuracy >99.9%
- Feature consistency between online/offline stores verified
- Integration tests passing with >95% success rate

**Business Validation**
- Real-time inference capability demonstrated
- Cost per feature request <$0.001
- System ready for Epic 3 serving layer integration

## Testing Requirements

### Test Scenarios
1. **Feature Registration**: Validate all 32 features correctly defined and registered
2. **Ingestion Pipeline**: Test batch and streaming ingestion from BigQuery
3. **Latency Performance**: Verify <50ms feature retrieval under load
4. **Data Consistency**: Validate online/offline feature alignment
5. **Error Handling**: Test failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms
6. **Scale Testing**: Validate performance under production load patterns

### Test Data
- Use sample market data from Story 2.2 deployment
- Create synthetic load testing scenarios
- Validate with real historical data patterns
