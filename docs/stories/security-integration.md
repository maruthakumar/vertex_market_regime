# Security Integration

## Existing Security Measures
**Authentication:** API key-based authentication for backtester endpoints
**Authorization:** Role-based access (admin, trader, analyst) with session management
**Data Protection:** Local data encryption at rest, TLS for API communications  
**Security Tools:** Input validation, SQL injection protection for HeavyDB queries

## Enhancement Security Requirements

**New Security Measures:**
- Google Cloud IAM integration with service accounts for Vertex AI access
- API key rotation for enhanced endpoints, OAuth 2.0 for interactive features
- Data pipeline encryption for HeavyDB â†’ BigQuery transfers
- ML model artifact signing and verification

**Integration Points:**
- Single sign-on integration between existing auth and Google Cloud Identity
- Audit logging for all ML model predictions and weight updates
- Data lineage tracking for compliance and debugging

**Compliance Requirements:**
- SOC 2 Type II readiness for cloud components
- Financial industry data retention (7 years) for ML training data
- GDPR compliance for any personal data in model training

## Security Testing
**Existing Security Tests:** Penetration testing of API endpoints, SQL injection testing
**New Security Test Requirements:** Vertex AI API security testing, data pipeline encryption validation, ML model poisoning attack prevention
**Penetration Testing:** Quarterly security assessment of cloud integration points and API attack surface
