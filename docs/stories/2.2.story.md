- Structured JSON output for all logging
- Error handling with graceful fallback and retry logic

### Important Implementation Notes
- This story focuses on deploying and validating the BigQuery tables already designed in Story 2.1
- IAM permissions setup will be handled in Story 2.5 - coordinate if blocked
- Use existing DDL files and scripts from Story 2.1 as foundation
- Ensure compatibility with Feature Store entity types from `/docs/ml/feature-store-spec.md`
- All BigQuery operations should use the Python client library with proper error handling

## Testing
