# Story 1.8: Component 7 Support/Resistance Feature Engineering (120+ Features)

## Status
âœ… Complete - QA Passed

## Story
**As a** quantitative developer,
**I want** to implement the Component 7 Support & Resistance **Feature Engineering Framework** that derives dynamic levels from Component 1's 10-parameter triple straddle system and Component 3's cumulative ATMÂ±7 analysis with multi-timeframe consensus and overlay indicators,
**so that** we provide **raw support/resistance level features** to Vertex AI ML models for automatic level strength classification, breakout/breakdown prediction, and market structure analysis without hard-coded classification rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE ENGINEERING ONLY FRAMEWORK** - No Hard-Coded Classifications
   - **Raw Level Feature Engineering** (72 features): Calculate support/resistance price levels, touch counts, bounce rates, volume confirmations, and confluence measurements
   - **Mathematical Level Detection** (36 features): Extract level prices, strength scores, age metrics, and validation counts from both straddle and underlying prices
   - **Dynamic Learning Features** (36 features): Compute method performance scores, weight adaptations, historical accuracy rates, and cross-validation metrics
   - **Total 72 systematic features** engineered for ML consumption with NO manual level strength classification

2. **âœ… COMPONENT 1 INTEGRATION** - Triple Rolling Straddle S&R Formation

  * Corrected directional logic (ITM1 rising = Bullish, OTM1 rising = Bearish)
  * Step-by-step S&R formation process with real market scenarios
  * Multi-timeframe consensus visualization
  
- **[story.1.8-additional-sr-patterns.md](./story.1.8-additional-sr-patterns.md)** - Comprehensive catalog of additional patterns:

### **Additional S&R Patterns Available**
[See story.1.8-additional-sr-patterns.md for comprehensive list]

**High-Priority OI-Based Patterns**:
- OI Concentration Walls (CE OI > 85th percentile = Resistance, PE OI > 85th percentile = Support)
- Max Pain Migration Levels (Previous max pain points become S&R)
- OI Flow Velocity S&R (Rapid OI accumulation creates future levels)
- Volume-Weighted OI Profile (Combines OI + Volume for true S&R)

**Advanced Straddle Patterns**:
- Triple Straddle Divergence (ATM/ITM1/OTM1 divergence points)
- Straddle Momentum Exhaustion (Momentum reversal = S&R formation)
- Dynamic Strike Adjustment Levels (As rolling strikes change)

**Cross-Component Synergies**:
- Greeks + OI Confluence (High Gamma + High OI = Pin Risk S&R)
- IV Skew Asymmetry S&R (Extreme skew = Support/Resistance)
- Multi-Timeframe CPR Confluence (D/W/M alignment on straddles)
- Correlation Breakdown S&R (Component 6 correlation breaks)

### **Component Integration Architecture**

**Component 1 (Triple Rolling Straddle) Level Formation**:
- **10 Parameters**: ATM/ITM1/OTM1 straddles + individual CE/PE components + correlation
- **Overlay Indicators Applied to Straddle Prices**:
  * EMA(20,50,100,200) on straddle prices â†’ dynamic S&R levels
  * VWAP on straddle price/volume â†’ volume-weighted S&R
    - Daily VWAP (resets each day) â†’ Intraday S&R level
    - Previous Day VWAP â†’ Historical reference S&R
  * Pivot Points on straddle prices â†’ key reversal levels
    - Standard Pivots (R3, R2, R1, PP, S1, S2, S3)
    - Current Day High/Low â†’ Intraday range S&R
    - Previous Day High/Low/Close â†’ Historical S&R reference points
- **Multi-Timeframe Consensus**: Levels validated across intraday to monthly timeframes

**Component 3 (Cumulative ATMÂ±7) Level Formation**:
- **Cumulative Analysis**: Sum of OI/prices across ATMÂ±7 strikes
- **Rolling Windows**: 5min (primary) and 15min (validation) for dynamic levels
- **Multi-Timeframe Consensus**: Confluence across different rolling periods

**Dual-Source Validation**:
```python
# Example: Level confluence scoring
def calculate_level_confluence(comp1_level, comp3_level, underlying_level):
    """
    Measure agreement between different S&R sources
    """
    proximity_threshold = 0.002  # 0.2% proximity for confluence
    
    # Check Component 1 vs Component 3 agreement
    straddle_confluence = abs(comp1_level - comp3_level) / comp1_level < proximity_threshold
    
    # Check straddle vs underlying agreement  
    underlying_confluence = abs(comp1_level - underlying_level) / comp1_level < proximity_threshold
    
    # Calculate confluence score
    confluence_score = (
        0.4 * straddle_confluence +     # Straddle sources agreement
        0.3 * underlying_confluence +    # Straddle vs underlying agreement
        0.3 * multi_timeframe_consensus  # Timeframe agreement
    )
    
    return confluence_score
```
