# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment:** SSH-based deployment with tmux session management and manual orchestration
**Infrastructure Tools:** HeavyDB cluster, Python virtual environments, systemd services for automation
**Environments:** Local development, staging server, production trading environment

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Hybrid cloud-local deployment maintaining HeavyDB infrastructure while adding Google Cloud ML services

**Infrastructure Changes:**
- Google Cloud project setup with Vertex AI, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage
- VPN connection between local HeavyDB and Google Cloud for secure data transfer
- Container registry for ML model artifacts and component deployments
- Enhanced monitoring with Google Cloud Monitoring integrated with existing systems

**Pipeline Integration:** 
- Extend existing BMAD orchestration system to include Vertex AI model deployment
- Automated data pipeline for HeavyDB â†’ BigQuery synchronization  
- CI/CD pipeline for ML model updates and component deployments
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime model updates

## Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Automated rollback to existing system with feature flags for gradual component activation

**Risk Mitigation:** 
- All new components have fallback to existing implementations
- Performance monitoring with automatic rollback triggers if latency >800ms
- Database transactions ensure data consistency during rollback
- Canary deployments for gradual traffic migration

**Monitoring:** 
- Real-time performance monitoring of all 8 components
- ML model drift detection with automatic retraining triggers
- Business metric tracking (accuracy, latency, throughput)
- Alert system for critical failures with automatic escalation
