# **7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

## **7.1 Technical Risks**

### **High Risk: Data Pipeline Migration**
**Risk**: Disruption to existing HeavyDB-based processing during migration  
**Impact**: Trading system downtime, data loss  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: 
- Parallel system operation during migration
- Comprehensive data validation at each stage
- Rollback procedures to existing system
- Extensive testing with historical data

### **High Risk: Component Implementation Complexity**  
**Risk**: 8 complex components may not meet performance targets
**Impact**: System performance degradation, accuracy loss
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Phased implementation with validation gates
- Performance monitoring at each component
- Fallback to existing components on failure
- Conservative performance targets with buffer

### **Medium Risk: Vertex AI Integration**
**Risk**: Cloud service dependencies and latency issues
**Impact**: Increased system latency, cloud costs
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Local fallback processing capability
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation  
- Cost monitoring and optimization
- Service level agreements with GCP

## **7.2 Business Risks**

### **Medium Risk: User Adoption**
**Risk**: Existing users resistant to new 8-regime system
**Impact**: Reduced system usage, training overhead
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain backward compatibility with 18-regime system
- Gradual migration with user choice
- Comprehensive training and documentation
- Clear performance improvement demonstration
