## 🎯 8-REGIME CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

The system classifies market conditions into 8 distinct regimes:

### Market Regimes
1. **LVLD** - Low Volatility Low Delta: Stable, low activity
2. **HVC** - High Volatility Contraction: Vol declining from highs  
3. **VCPE** - Volatility Contraction Price Expansion: Low vol, strong direction
4. **TBVE** - Trend Breaking Volatility Expansion: Reversal with vol increase
5. **TBVS** - Trend Breaking Volatility Suppression: Controlled reversal
6. **SCGS** - Strong Correlation Good Sentiment: High agreement, positive sentiment
7. **PSED** - Poor Sentiment Elevated Divergence: Negative sentiment, disagreement
8. **CBV** - Choppy Breakout Volatility: Sideways with vol spikes

### Dynamic Adaptation
Each regime definition includes adaptive component signatures that learn optimal detection patterns from historical performance.
