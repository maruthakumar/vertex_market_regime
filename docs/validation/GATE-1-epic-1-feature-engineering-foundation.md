# Gate 1 Validation — Epic 1: Feature Engineering Foundation
Date: 2025-08-12  
Status: PASSED — GO  
Owner: PO / Platform / QA

## Evidence Summary
- Feature counts per component met:
  - C1: 120, C2: 98, C3: 105, C4: 87, C5: 94, C6: 200+, C7: 72, C8: 48
- Parity harness reports: train vs infer parity — PASSED for all components
- Performance baseline recorded under `docs/performance/fe-baseline.md`
- Output contracts in schema registry: component_score, component_confidence, transition_thresholds

## Artifacts
- PRD: `docs/prd.md`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
- Components: `docs/market_regime/*`
- Epic: `docs/stories/epic-1-feature-engineering-foundation.md`
- Performance Baseline: `docs/performance/fe-baseline.md`
- Calibration: `docs/validation/component-calibration/` (samples)

## Decision
Proceed to Epic 2: Data Pipeline Modernization (`docs/stories/epic-2-data-pipeline-modernization.md`).

## Notes/Risks
- C6 enhanced feature set (200+) increases runtime risk; monitor budgets
- Parquet sample coverage to be expanded in Epic 2 for cloud datasets
